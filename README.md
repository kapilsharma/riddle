# Riddle

## Purpose

A simple test project.

As functional requirement, I'm solving simple riddle. However major goal is to write a MVP assuming it is a real
product and will be enhanced in future.

Thus goal is to follow TDD approach with full separation of concern. It must follow all coding best practices and
SOLID principles.

Instead of using any framework, I'm doing it in core PHP. However another goal is to design product in such a way
that we can implement it in any PHP framework without much changes.

## Functional requirements

You have 9 balls, equally big, equally heavy - except for one, which is a little heavier.

How would you identify the heavier ball if you could use a pair of balance scales only twice?

## Technical requirements

1. Draw a „Flow chart“ in PNG Format (and optional .xmi or .dia)
2. Write the code to solve this problem
    - Use classes in php5
    - Store every move of every game in a MySQL database
    - Simple HTML + jQuery game with Auto-Play and Auto-Replay features
    - Unit tests
